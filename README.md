# Timothy-Cebula-Water--2048

2048 

User experience:

The objective of the game is to reach the 2048 tile. The player starts the game with two randomly generated blocks. The player slides blocks either up, down, left, or right. When the same numbered blocks collide, the value doubles. The player needs to score as many points as possible. After every move, a new block will generate.

Installation Instructions

Download and copy either the SSH or HTTPS key. Make a new directory using mkdir in your terminal for where you want this to go. Once you made that, you need to use the git clone and paste the url that you copied earlier.

Major Hurdles

My most major hurdle was the logic of the slider. Every time I made a minor tweak on it, it would either break the whole application or just not work. It took me a few days to get it to slide everything correctly, and also combine together correctly was a huge challenge. 

Future Goals

I would still like to add a reset game. I also never changed the colors of the tiles, I just left them all at blue and white. I would have liked to work more on the CSS of the game to make it look better, but I was working on the functionality the whole time.
