// Setting up the board
// console.log("Test")
// The board is a square, width and height will be equal
// The board has a slim border
// Each square in the board will be slightly smaller than a quarter the size of the height and width 

// Numbers 

// The numbers will be colored differently
// if the number is 2 or 4: they should have a gray color with a black Font
// if number is 8: orange with white font 
// if number is 16: slightly more red orange than 8 with a white font
// if number is 32: slightly more red than 16 with a white font
// if number is 64: even more red than 32 with a white font
// if number is 128: light shade of yellow with a white font
// if number is 256: slightly darker shade of yellow with a white font
// if number is 512: browner shade of yellow with a white font
// if number is 1024: slightly more brown shade of yellow with a white font
// if number is 2048: darkest shade of yellow with a white font

// Assign each tile with an ID
// Create an array within an array that will display the numbers on the board
// If number is 0 then that spot will be blank
// addEventListener keyup, keydown, keyleft, keyright will respond to the movements

// Create a slide function that will modify the array with the new numbers
// The slide should push all numbers to whatever direction the user choses
// If the index is 0 slide to the next index until it hits either: 
//  The wall, a different number, or the same number
// If it hits the same number then the numbers need to combine and double in value

// After every move a 2 will be placed on the board 90% of the time, the other 10% a 4 will be placed somewhere randomly on the board

// If the board is full and no moves are available the player loses

// Reset Game

// Create a button called reset with addEventListener and a function to clear the board and reset it to a new game
